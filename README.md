This app was created as in exercise in using Gemini 2.5 experimental to assist with building a simple polyhedron net folder.
Having no experience with 3D graphics, I thought this would be a good choice to test its visualization
skills and for me to learn about animation and the 3D rendering libraries.
Sample Platonic and Archimedean solid nets are available under the presets contol.
One the features I took great advantage of was uploading screen captures for certain
rendering bugs. The AI would explain in fairly good detail what it was viewing to
assist in defect triage. This saved quite a bit time.
Another was asking for detailed console logging.
